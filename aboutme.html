        <h1>Vendetta</h1>
        <p>Vendetta's super power consists of being able to inflict the power of karma to those who do wrong.
            As well, the principle of karma also rewards those who do good. Essentially, she acts as judge, jury,
            and executioner to all people she becomes involved with.
